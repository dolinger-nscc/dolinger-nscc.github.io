    "Many students ask what they should brush up on before starting a Business Intelligence and Analytics program. In a nutshell, I would recommend you make sure you are comfortable with advanced worksheet operations in Excel. This would include pivot tables, lookups (i.e. v-lookups), built-in functions, and data tables. Reviewing the statistical package in Excel as well as reviewing inferential statistics is a good idea as well for when you begin working with statistical learning models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I would also recommend you explore an open source database like SQLite (see link below for free resources).  "

    "Many public libraries and schools in Canada have an agreement with [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/). With Technology changing as fast as it does, traditional textbooks cannot keep up. Using videos in lieu of text reading assignments helps with the fast-changing technical landscape. You can access LinkedIn Learning free of charge with your student id from many schools, or your public library id as well. Check your local library page for availability.\n",

    "I access LinkedIn Learning through the [Halifax Public Libraries](https://www.halifaxpubliclibraries.ca/blogs/post/how-to-learn-with-linkedin-learning/)! Just follow the instructions on the link. If you live outside of the HRM, like I do, you can still get a Halifax Library card free of charge as long as you a resident of Nova Scotia.  \n",

    "[Excel Statistics Essential Training: 1](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/excel-statistics-essential-training-1-2/) Joseph Schmuller is a renowned author.

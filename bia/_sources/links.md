# Prep and Links
---

Many students ask what they should brush up on before starting the program. In a nutshell, I would recommend you make sure you are comfortable with advanced worksheet operations in Excel. This would include pivot tables, lookups (i.e. v-lookups), built-in functions, and data tables. Reviewing the statistical package in Excel as well as reviewing inferential statistics is a good idea as well for when get into statistical learning.  

I would also recommend you explore an open source database like SQLite (see link below for free resources).  



I will add more links as I find them:  

[W3 Schools SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp) - an excellent intro to the base SQL skills.  

[SQLite and SQLite browser](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) - my favourite database! I taught intro to databases and had my students use this for the course, most kept the database on a USB drive on their keychains. 

[OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/) This is a project that I feel is the future of textbooks going forward. The OpenIntro Statistics book is available free as a pdf and can be purchased for $20 Cdn on [amazon.ca](https://www.amazon.ca/OpenIntro-Statistics-Fourth-David-Diez/dp/1943450072/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=openintro+statistics&qid=1622044623&sr=8-1) if you like a bound copy. The labs contain both R and Python code samples. 

[Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/) Working with code in SQL, Python, or R is ultimately working with mathematics. A great, and free, resource is provided thanks to Cambridge University Press.


NSCC has an agreement with [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/). With Technology changing as fast as it does, traditional textbooks cannot keep up. Using videos in lieu of text reading assignments helps with the fast-changing technical landscape. You can access LinkedIn Learning free of charge with your NSCC account and password. 

This video will show you how to login to LinkedIn Learning with your NSCC account credentials. If you are not yet a student and do not have an NSCC email address you can still access LinkedIn Learning through the [Halifax Public Libraries](https://www.halifaxpubliclibraries.ca/blogs/post/how-to-learn-with-linkedin-learning/)! Just follow the instructions on the link. If you live outside of the HRM, like I do, you can still get a Halifax Library card free of charge as long as you a resident of Nova Scotia.

Some courses that could help with course prep are as follows:  
[Statistics Foundations:](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/statistics-foundations-the-basics/) The Basics - Eddie is a great instructor. This is a great 1st Statistics Course. If you enjoy this course, you can look up Eddie's 3-part course on inferential statistics.  

[Excel Statistics Essential Training: 1](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/excel-statistics-essential-training-1-2/) Joseph Schmuller is a renowned author. He comes across a bit dry as an instructor, but does he ever know how to extend Excel into inferential statistics. It's worth a watch.  

[Excel Statistics Training: 2](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/excel-statistics-essential-training-2-2/) If you like Joseph's part 1 of the series, here is part 2.  



[Learning SQL Programming](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-sql-programming-8382385/) If it were my choice, I would use this database (SQLite Browser) and this course to teach an "Intro to Databases" course.

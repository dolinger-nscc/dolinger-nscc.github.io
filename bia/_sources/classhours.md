# Class Hours and Expectations
---

**Below is the tentative schedule for the 2022-2023 school year.**

The program is being scheduled for 2022-23 as a *'blended'* delivery. The class schedule may look a little confusing at first, but this structure allows you to complete pre-requisite concepts before encountering them in a follow-up class. An example would be you will not go into Data Design II while still trying to master the SQL language. You will be able to apply your SQL skills from the BI Programming (DDL and DML) course straight away.  

The expectations for the course are as follows, **note** the times for online and in person meetings are tentative and subject to change prior to each semester:  
*  You will attend the online sessions via Teams MWF from 8:30 - 12:30 daily. The classes on MWF will introduce the topics covered that week. 
*  You will attend the courses in person on Tuesdays and Thursdays at the IT Campus from 8:30 - 3:00 daily. The T/Th technical classes will be assessment and lab days. Assessments will consist of tests and 'tech-checks' (mini assignments to measure understanding and application). Tuesdays and Thursdays 8:30 - 10:30 will be the BAE course in the fall and the special topics course in the winter.
*  Many students find they can complete much of their work during the in-class lab times as stated above. However, they do report that projects and some extra lab time was required and required an average of about 10 - 15 hours of week of independent study. 
*  The contact hours you are scheduled for amount to 24 hours. Keep this in mind if you are working part-time as well. 
*  With the contact hours being 24 hours per week, make sure to take advantage of all lab times. Be prepared to take advantage of instructor access and be prepared for lab days (Tuesdays and Thursdays).

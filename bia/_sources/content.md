# Business Intelligence and Analytics 2022-23 Cohort
---

This will be the sixth cohort to participate in Nova Scotia's Community College [Business Intelligence and Analytics](https://www.nscc.ca/learning_programs/programs/plandescr.aspx?prg=BZIA&pln=BZNTELADV) program. For those of you considering or have already been accepted to the program, Welcome!  

The number of buzzwords that surround our industry can make it difficult to understand the many opportunities it affords. Even the name of our program (BIA) at NSCC was confusing before the update in Feb 2022. Business Intelligence *and* Analytics really encompasses two broad areas of the Data Science spectrum. This site will introduce you to the scope of the program and some of the technologies you will be learning during the year.  

There will also be a page, [*Prep and Links*](https://dolinger.ca/bia/links.html), I will keep updated to help you prepare for your course prior to classes beginning in September.

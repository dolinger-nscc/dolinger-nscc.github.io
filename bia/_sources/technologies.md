# Technologies and Languages

Even though the importance in learning should be on the concepts and not the tools, we still need to use tools in our learning! I have picked the core tools we will be using in class based on what the industry calls for currently. Obviously, Nova Scotia business demands are a priority with national trends also being evaluated each year. Below is a table showing why I have chosen the tools we will be using. Technology changes frequently and there could be minor changes as next year progresses. For example, through 2020 I had been teaching the Statistical Learning course using the R programming language. Due to the increased demand for analysts to be exposed to the modules / libraries available in Python, we will be using Python this year in the Intro to Data Science and Applied Data Science courses.


| Technology                             | Reason Chosen                                        |     
| :---                                   |  ---:                                                |
| Power Query and PowerBI                | Beginning to lead as the go-to tools for BI          |
| MS SQL Server                          | The most used RDBMS for data warehouses              |
| SSRS and SSIS                          | Commonly used for standard reporting and ETL         |
| Python and DS Modules                  | More in demand than R for the past 3-4 years         |

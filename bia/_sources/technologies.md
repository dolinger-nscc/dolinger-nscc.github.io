# Technologies and Languages

Even though the importance in learning should be on the concepts and not the tools, we still need to use tools in our learning! I have picked the core tools we will be using in class based on what the industry calls for. Obviously, Nova Scotia business demands are a priority with national trends also being evaluated. Below is a table showing why I have chosen the tools we will be using. Technology changes frequently and there could be minor changes as next year progresses. For example, through 2020 I had been teaching the Statistical Learning course using the R programming language. Due to the increased demand for analysts to be exposed to the libraries available in Python, we will using Python this year in Intro to Data Science yet still covering the same concepts as we had previously using R. 


| Technology                             | Reason Chosen                                        |     
| :---                                   |  ---:                                                |
| Power Query and PowerBI                | Beginning to lead as the go-to tools for BI          |
| MS SQL Server                          | The most used RDBMS for data warehouses              |
| SSRS and SSIS                          | Commonly used for standard reporting and ETL         |
| Python and PyCaret                     | More in demand than R for the past 3-4 years         |

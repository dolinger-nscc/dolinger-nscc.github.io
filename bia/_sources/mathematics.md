# Mathematics in Analytics
---

A question often asked is, "How strong do my mathematics skills need to write code required for machine learning?"  
A simple answer is an understanding of Statistics, Linear Algebra, and Calculus. The answer is really, "It depends". The quote below is from the [Mathematics for Machines Learning](https://mml-book.com) text that is available for free by Cambridge University Press. I do recommend downloading the book in pdf format and at least scanning it to get an understanding of the skills that are utilized in machine learning. Because of available tools and varying roles using Analytics there is a spectrum of skills required depending on the role. The analogy to music from the book provides a good explanation: 


> In analogy to music, there are three types of interaction that people have with machine learning:
>
> **Astute Listener** The democratization of machine learning by the provision of open-source software, online tutorials and cloud-based tools allows users to not worry about the specifics of pipelines. Users can focus on extracting insights from data using off-the-shelf tools. This enables non tech-savvy domain experts to benefit from machine learning. This is similar to listening to music; the user is able to choose and discern between different types of machine learning, and benefits from it. More experienced users are like music critics, asking important questions about the application of machine learning in society such as ethics, fairness, and privacy of the individual. We hope that this book provides a foundation for thinking about the certification and risk management of machine learning systems, and allows them to use their domain expertise to build better machine learning systems.

> **Experienced Artist** Skilled practitioners of machine learning can plug and play different tools and libraries into an analysis pipeline. The stereotypical practitioner would be a data scientist or engineer who understands machine learning interfaces and their use cases, and is able to perform wonderful feats of prediction from data. This is similar to a virtuoso playing music, where highly skilled practitioners can bring existing instruments to life and bring enjoyment to their audience. Using the mathematics presented here as a primer, practitioners would be able to understand the benefits and limits of their favorite method, and to extend and generalize existing machine learning algorithms. We hope that this book provides the impetus for more rigorous and principled development of machine learning methods.
>
> **Fledgling Composer** As machine learning is applied to new domains, developers of machine learning need to develop new methods and extend
existing algorithms. They are often researchers who need to understand the mathematical basis of machine learning and uncover relationships between different tasks. This is similar to composers of music who, within the rules and structure of musical theory, create new and amazing pieces. We hope this book provides a high-level overview of other technical books for people who want to become composers of machine learning. There is a great need in society for new researchers who are able to propose and explore novel approaches for attacking the many challenges of learning from data.

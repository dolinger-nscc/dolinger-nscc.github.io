With a better understanding of the three pillars of data science, let's now take a deeper dive into the areas  and associated roles under the data science umbrella. This blog entry from [365 DataScience.com](https://365datascience.com/trending/data-science-vs-ml-vs-data-analytics/) does a  good job explaining the areas of data science in a matrix of technical areas across an *all time horizons* x-axis. Although the blog entry is focused on differences between common terms you will often hear mentioned, the info diagram that is created allows for a high level scope the technical classes  in the program addresses.  

The red box below outlines the areas of focus the program classes will address.

# Quick Intro and Courses
---

My name is Patrick Dolinger and I will be your instructor for the majority of your courses. I am assigned to teach all of the courses in the program except for *Business Analysis Essentials* and *Special Topics*. I find it exciting to teach BI and Analytics as I have over 20 years experience in the analytics field. Prior to my first analytics experience I was a software developer for Microsoft. Part of what make analytics such an interesting field is that people come into from a variety of backgrounds, technical, statistical, business, engineering, and more. Since the program covers a lot of ground in a short time, I have structured the courses in a modular delivery fashion. This ensures you will take no more than two technical courses concurrently. Modular design allows you time to focus on the skills needed and to build upon them in each course.  

The courses I teach by semester are as follows:  

| Fall Semester                                 | Winter Semester                         |
| :---                                          | ---:                                    |
| Intro to BI                                   | Data Provisioning (ETL)                 |
| Intro to BI Programming (SQL)                 | Intro to Data Science                   |
| Data Reporting                                | Applied Data Science                    |
| Database Design                               | Capstone Project                        |  


I look forward to seeing you in class!

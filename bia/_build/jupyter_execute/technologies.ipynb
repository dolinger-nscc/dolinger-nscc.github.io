    "Even though the importance in learning should be on the concepts and not the tools, we still need to use tools in our learning! I have picked the core tools we will be using in class based on what the industry calls for currently. Obviously, Canadian business demands are a priority in what I select for teaching and I continue to revisit the tools each year. Below is a table showing why I have chosen the tools we will be using. Technology changes frequently and there could be minor changes as next year progresses. For example, through 2020 I had been teaching a Statistical Learning course using the R programming language. Due to the increased demand for analysts to be exposed to the modules / libraries available in Python, I am now using Python this for an Intro to Data Science and an Applied Data Science.\n",
